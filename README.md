# Real-Time-Image-Segmentation-and-Classification
Developing a real-time image classification and segmentation system using advanced deep learning techniques for accurately identifying and segmenting objects within an image provided through a graphical user interface (GUI). The results should be presented both as text and spoken words, making the system more efficient, scalable, and adaptable to various environments.
Aim to enhance the accessibility, efficiency, and functionality of visual content processing.

#Language:

This is a Python Project Using Deep Learning

#How To Use it:-

1.Run the CIFAR_10_Image_Classification.ipynb file in Google colab.

2.When the model.h5 model file is saved upload it in Jupyter Notebook.

3. CIFAR-10 Image Segmentation & Classifier Final this file contains the GUI code run this and the system is ready.
